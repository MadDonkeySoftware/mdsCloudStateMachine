* Run data should be as short lived as possible
    * I.e. executions and child data should be evicted from the system on a short regular schedule
        * Ex: between 1 and 30 days. Ideally evicted after shipping to logging store
    * The intent here is for operators to house logs and other such data in a more robust logging store

## Technologies

* Used by fnProject
    * [Databases](https://github.com/fnproject/docs/blob/master/fn/operate/databases/README.md)
        * sqlite3 (default)
    * [Message Queues](https://github.com/fnproject/docs/blob/master/fn/operate/message-queues.md)
        * Bolt is golang specific, Alternative needed.
